                    <p>Association football is one of a family of football codes, which emerged from various ball games played worldwide since antiquity. The modern game traces its origins to 1863 when the Laws of the Game were originally codified in England by The Football Association.</p>
                    <p>The FA is a member of both UEFA and FIFA and holds a permanent seat on the International Football Association Board (IFAB) which is responsible for the Laws of the Game. </p>

He has spent his entire professional career with Barcelona, where he has won a club-record 32 trophies, including nine La Liga titles, four UEFA Champions League titles and six Copas del Rey.</p>

                    <p>Messi landed awkwardly on his elbow after tangling with Franco Vazquez and had to be taken off in the 17th minute. Vazquez was shielding the ball from the Barcelona captain and Messi tripped over his leg and landed on top of his elbow.</p>
